# Forage Stores Backend - Complete API Testing Guide for Beginners

This comprehensive guide will teach you how to test **ALL** endpoints and features of the Forage Stores Backend API. Whether you're a beginner or experienced developer, this guide will walk you through every step.

## 📋 What You'll Learn

- How to set up and access the API
- How to authenticate (login/register) 
- How to test every endpoint step-by-step
- How to handle different user roles and permissions
- Real-world examples with sample data
- Common troubleshooting tips

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have:
- ✅ Node.js installed on your computer
- ✅ The Forage Stores Backend project running
- ✅ A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
- ✅ Basic understanding of JSON format (we'll explain as we go)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 1: Start the Application

Open your terminal/command prompt and run:
```bash
# Navigate to the project folder
cd forage-stores-backend

# Install dependencies (if not already done)
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run start:dev
```

**What this does:** Starts the API server on your local machine (usually port 3000)

### Step 2: Access the Interactive API Documentation (Swagger)

1. Open your web browser
2. Go to: `http://localhost:3000/api`
3. You should see a page with all the API endpoints listed

**What is Swagger?** It's a visual interface that lets you test APIs directly from your browser without writing code. Think of it as a "control panel" for your API.

## 🔐 Understanding Authentication

**What is Authentication?** 
Authentication is like showing your ID card to prove who you are. Most API endpoints require you to be "logged in" before you can use them.

**How it works:**
1. You register an account or login with existing credentials
2. The API gives you a special "token" (like a temporary pass)
3. You include this token with future requests to prove you're authorized

### 🎯 Complete Authentication Workflow

Let's walk through the complete process of getting authenticated and creating your first store:

## � Step-by-Step: How to Get Authenticated and Create a Store

### Step 1: Register a New User Account

**Why do this?** You need an account to create stores and access protected features.

**Endpoint:** `POST /auth/register`

**What to do:**
1. In Swagger, find the "auth" section
2. Click on `POST /auth/register`
3. Click "Try it out"
4. Replace the example data with:

```json
{
  "name": "John Store Owner",
  "email": "john.storeowner@example.com",
  "phone": "+2348123456789",
  "password": "MySecure123!",
  "accountType": "business",
  "role": "user",
  "city": "Lagos",
  "referralCode": "REF123456"
}
```

**Important Fields Explained:**
- `name`: Your full name (required)
- `email`: Must be unique (no one else can use this email) (required)
- `phone`: Your phone number (include country code) (optional)
- `password`: Must be strong (8+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, number, special char) (required)
- `accountType`: Use "business" if you plan to create stores, "family" for regular users (optional)
- `role`: Always use "user" (admin accounts are created separately) (optional)
- `city`: Your city/location (optional)
- `referralCode`: Code from someone who referred you (optional)

5. Click "Execute"

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": "64f123456789abcdef123456",
    "name": "John Store Owner",
    "email": "john.storeowner@example.com",
    "phone": "+2348123456789",
    "accountType": "business",
    "role": "user"
  },
  "accessToken": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiI2NGYxMjM0NTY3ODlhYmNkZWYxMjM0NTYiLCJlbWFpbCI6ImpvaG5AZXhhbXBsZS5jb20iLCJyb2xlIjoidXNlciIsImFjY291bnRUeXBlIjoiYnVzaW5lc3MiLCJpYXQiOjE2OTA0NzM2MDAsImV4cCI6MTY5MDU2MDAwMH0.example_token_signature"
}
```

**🔑 IMPORTANT:** Copy the `accessToken` value (the long string starting with "eyJ"). You'll need this for the next steps!

### Step 2: Alternative - Login (if you already have an account)

**If you already registered before, use this instead:**

**Endpoint:** `POST /auth/login`

```json
{
  "email": "john.storeowner@example.com",
  "password": "MySecure123!"
}
```

### Step 3: Authenticate Your Requests

**What is this?** Every time you want to access protected endpoints, you need to include your token.

**How to do it in Swagger:**
1. Look for the "Authorize" button at the top of the Swagger page (🔒 icon)
2. Click it
3. In the "Value" field, type: `Bearer ` followed by your token
   
   Example: `Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...`
   
   **Note:** Don't forget the space after "Bearer"!

4. Click "Authorize"
5. Close the dialog

**What this does:** Now all your requests will automatically include the authentication token.

### Step 4: Create Your First Store

**Now the fun part!** Let's create your store.

**Endpoint:** `POST /stores`

**What to do:**
1. Find the "stores" section in Swagger
2. Click on `POST /stores`
3. Click "Try it out"
4. Use this data:

```json
{
  "name": "Fresh Foods Market",
  "description": "Premium fresh foods and organic groceries delivered to your door",
  "address": "123 Market Street, Lagos, Nigeria",
  "phone": "+2348123456789",
  "email": "contact@freshfoods.com"
}
```

**Field Explanations:**
- `name`: Your store's name (will be visible to customers) (required)
- `description`: What your store sells (helps customers understand your business) (optional)
- `address`: Physical location of your store (required)
- `phone`: Store contact number (optional)
- `email`: Store contact email (optional)
- `phone`: Store contact number
- `email`: Store contact email

5. Click "Execute"

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "id": "64f987654321abcdef654321",
  "name": "Fresh Foods Market",
  "description": "Premium fresh foods and organic groceries delivered to your door",
  "address": "123 Market Street, Lagos, Nigeria",
  "phone": "+2348123456789",
  "email": "contact@freshfoods.com",
  "createdAt": "2025-07-25T10:30:00.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2025-07-25T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```

**🎉 Congratulations!** You've successfully:
- ✅ Created a user account
- ✅ Authenticated with the API
- ✅ Created your first store

**📝 Important Notes:**
- **Save your store ID:** Copy the `id` from the response (you'll need it for adding products)
- **Token expires:** Your access token expires after 24 hours, then you'll need to login again
- **Store ownership:** Only you can update/delete stores you created

## 🔍 Testing Other Endpoints

Now that you're authenticated, you can test any endpoint marked with a 🔒 lock icon. Here are some next steps:

1. **View your profile:** `GET /auth/profile`
2. **Browse all stores:** `GET /stores` (no authentication needed)
3. **Add products to your store:** `POST /products`
4. **Create orders:** `POST /orders/checkout`

## ❗ Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "Unauthorized" or "Access token is required"
**Solution:** Make sure you:
1. Completed the authentication step (Step 3 above)
2. Your token hasn't expired (login again if needed)
3. Used "Bearer " before your token (with a space)

### Issue: "User already exists"
**Solution:** 
1. Try logging in instead of registering
2. Use a different email address

### Issue: "Validation failed"
**Solution:** 
1. Check your JSON format (use the examples provided)
2. Make sure all required fields are included
3. Check password requirements (8+ chars, mixed case, numbers, special chars)

**Common Checkout Errors:**
- `400 Bad Request - "Cart is empty"`: Add items to cart first
- `400 Bad Request - "Insufficient stock"`: One or more products don't have enough stock
- `400 Bad Request - "Product no longer available"`: Product was deleted after adding to cart
- `400 Bad Request - "Invalid delivery address"`: Required address fields missing for home delivery

**🚨 Recently Fixed Issues:**
- ✅ **DTO Validation Error**: Fixed incorrect `CheckoutDto` export that was causing validation errors for `amount` and `paymentMethod` fields
- ✅ **ObjectId Error**: Fixed "input must be a 24 character hex string" error when processing populated cart items during checkout

**💳 Payment Process - IMPORTANT WORKFLOW:**

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: You MUST complete checkout first before making payment!

**Step 1: Complete Checkout Process**
```bash
POST /orders/checkout
# This creates an order and returns an order ID
```

**Step 2: Use the Returned Order ID for Payment**
```bash
POST /orders/{ORDER_ID_FROM_CHECKOUT}/payment
# Use the "_id" field from checkout response as the order ID
```

**📋 Example Checkout Response:**
```json
{
  "orderNumber": "ORD-926860154",
  "_id": "688a01eeabaaabdea89fa204",  // ← THIS is the Order ID to use!
  "remainingAmount": 1000,           // ← Use this as payment amount
  "finalTotal": 1000,
  "status": "pending",
  // ... other fields
}
```

**📝 Payment Request Example:**
```bash
POST /orders/688a01eeabaaabdea89fa204/payment
{
  "amount": 1000,                    // ← Must match remainingAmount
  "paymentMethod": "food_money",
  "transactionRef": "TXN123456789",
  "notes": "Payment via Food Money wallet"
}
```

**🚨 Common Mistakes:**
- ❌ Using `orderNumber` instead of `_id`
- ❌ Using `productId` instead of order `_id`
- ❌ Wrong payment amount (must match `remainingAmount`)

**🔍 Troubleshooting Payment Errors:**

**Error: "Order not found" (404)**
- ✅ **Most Common Cause**: Using an invalid or non-existent order ID
- ✅ **Solution**: First complete checkout to get a valid order ID
- ✅ **Check**: Ensure the order ID is exactly as returned from checkout response

**Error: "You can only make payments for your own orders" (403)**
- ✅ **Cause**: Authentication mismatch - you're not logged in as the user who created the order
- ✅ **Solution**: Login as the same user who created the order
- ✅ **Check**: Compare your current user ID with the order's `userId` field

**Error: "Wallet not found for this user" (404)**
- ✅ **Cause**: You don't have a wallet created yet
- ✅ **Solution**: Create a wallet first before making payments
- ✅ **Check**: GET `/wallets/my-wallet` should return your wallet details

**🔧 Quick Fixes for Wallet Issues:**
```bash
# 1. Create your wallet first (No request body needed!)
POST /wallets/create

# 2. Verify wallet creation
GET /wallets/my-wallet

# 3. If wallet has 0 balance, get admin to top up:
# Admin endpoint to add funds:
PATCH /wallets/admin/{YOUR_USER_ID}/balance
{
  "amount": 2000.00,
  "walletType": "foodMoney",
  "transactionType": "credit",
  "description": "Initial wallet funding"
}

# 4. Then make payment
POST /orders/{ORDER_ID}/payment
{
  "amount": 1000,
  "paymentMethod": "food_money"
}
```

**Alternative Payment Methods if No Wallet Balance:**
- `"cash"`: Cash on delivery
- `"card"`: Credit/debit card payment
- `"bank_transfer"`: Bank transfer payment

**💡 Pro Tip:** For testing purposes, use admin endpoints to fund your wallet, or use alternative payment methods like `"cash"` which don't require wallet balance.

**🚨 Non-Admin Users:** If you don't have admin privileges, use these payment methods instead:
- ✅ `"cash"` - Cash on delivery (works without wallet)
- ✅ `"card"` - Credit/debit card payment (works without wallet)  
- ✅ `"bank_transfer"` - Bank transfer payment (works without wallet)

**🔑 For Admin Testing:** Create an admin user to test wallet top-up features:
```bash
POST /auth/register
{
  "name": "Admin Tester",
  "email": "admin@test.com", 
  "password": "AdminPass123!",
  "accountType": "business",
  "role": "admin"
}
```

**🔧 Quick Fixes for 403 Error:**
```bash
# 1. Check your current user
GET /users/profile

# 2. Check the order details
GET /orders/{ORDER_ID}

# 3. Login as the correct user
POST /auth/login
{
  "email": "correct_user_email",
  "password": "correct_password"
}

# 4. Then retry payment
POST /orders/{ORDER_ID}/payment
```

**Steps to Fix:**
1. **First, add items to cart**: `POST /orders/cart/add`
2. **Then checkout**: `POST /orders/checkout` → Save the returned order ID!
3. **Finally, make payment**: `POST /orders/{ACTUAL_ORDER_ID}/payment`

**🚨 IMPORTANT - Don't Confuse Checkout with Payment!**

**Checkout vs Payment:**
- **Checkout (`POST /orders/checkout`)**: Creates an order from your cart items. Uses `CheckoutDto` format shown above.
- **Payment (`POST /orders/{orderId}/payment`)**: Processes payment for an existing order. Uses `PaymentDto` format below.

**If you get validation errors mentioning `amount` and `paymentMethod` on checkout:**
This likely means there's a DTO configuration issue. The checkout endpoint should NOT require these fields - they're for the payment endpoint. Restart the server to ensure the latest DTO fixes are applied.

#### Process Payment for Order (🔒 Authentication Required)
**Endpoint:** `POST /orders/{orderId}/payment`

**⚠️ Prerequisites:** You must have a created order from checkout first!

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "amount": 1200,
  "paymentMethod": "food_money",
  "transactionRef": "TXN123456789",
  "notes": "Payment via Food Money wallet"
}
```

**Payment Method Options:**
- `"food_money"`: Payment from Food Money wallet
- `"food_points"`: Payment using Food Points
- `"cash"`: Cash payment (for pickup orders)
- `"card"`: Credit/debit card payment
- `"bank_transfer"`: Bank transfer payment

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "payment": {
    "id": "64f777888999abcdef777888",
    "orderId": "64f555666777abcdef555666",
    "amount": 1200,
    "paymentMethod": "food_money",
    "status": "completed",
    "transactionRef": "TXN123456789",
    "processedAt": "2025-07-30T11:00:00.000Z"
  },
  "order": {
    "id": "64f555666777abcdef555666",
    "status": "paid",
    "paymentStatus": "completed"
  },
  "message": "Payment processed successfully"
}
```

## 🧪 NEW CART SYSTEM - COMPREHENSIVE TESTING SCENARIOS

**Test these scenarios to understand the new cart system's capabilities:**

### Scenario 1: Basic Shopping Flow
```bash
# Step 1: Add items to cart
POST /orders/cart/add
{
  "productId": "PRODUCT_ID_1",
  "quantity": 2
}

# Step 2: Add another item
POST /orders/cart/add
{
  "productId": "PRODUCT_ID_2", 
  "quantity": 1
}

# Step 3: View cart
GET /orders/cart

# Step 4: Update quantity
PATCH /orders/cart/PRODUCT_ID_1
{
  "quantity": 3
}

# Step 5: Checkout
POST /orders/checkout
{
  "paymentPlan": {"type": "pay_now", "payNowDetails": {}},
  "deliveryMethod": "home_delivery",
  "deliveryAddress": {"street": "123 Test St", "city": "Lagos", "state": "Lagos", "postalCode": "100001"}
}
```

### Scenario 2: Stock Validation Testing
```bash
# Test stock limits - try adding more than available
POST /orders/cart/add
{
  "productId": "PRODUCT_WITH_LOW_STOCK",
  "quantity": 999  # This should fail with stock error
}

# Add valid quantity first
POST /orders/cart/add
{
  "productId": "PRODUCT_ID",
  "quantity": 5
}

# Try adding more than remaining stock
POST /orders/cart/add
{
  "productId": "PRODUCT_ID",  # Same product
  "quantity": 10  # If total exceeds stock, this fails
}
```

### Scenario 3: Cart Persistence Testing
```bash
# Add items to cart
POST /orders/cart/add
{
  "productId": "PRODUCT_ID",
  "quantity": 2
}

# Wait some time or logout/login

# Check cart is still there
GET /orders/cart  # Should return items added before
```

### Scenario 4: Price Locking Testing
```bash
# Step 1: Add item to cart (price locked)
POST /orders/cart/add
{
  "productId": "PRODUCT_ID",
  "quantity": 1
}

# Step 2: Store owner updates product price
PATCH /products/PRODUCT_ID
{
  "price": 2000  # Changed from 1000 to 2000
}

# Step 3: Check cart still has old price
GET /orders/cart  # unitPrice should still be 1000, not 2000

# Step 4: Checkout uses locked price
POST /orders/checkout
# Order total uses the locked price (1000), not new price (2000)
```

### Scenario 5: Cart Expiration Testing
```bash
# This would require waiting 30 days or manually updating database
# For testing, admin can manually set expiration date in past

# Check expired cart behavior
GET /orders/cart  # Should return empty cart if expired

# Add to expired cart creates new cart
POST /orders/cart/add
{
  "productId": "PRODUCT_ID",
  "quantity": 1
}
```

### Scenario 6: Error Handling Testing
```bash
# Test empty cart checkout
DELETE /orders/cart  # Clear cart first
POST /orders/checkout  # Should fail with "Cart is empty"

# Test invalid product
POST /orders/cart/add
{
  "productId": "000000000000000000000000",  # Invalid ID
  "quantity": 1
}

# Test negative quantity
POST /orders/cart/add
{
  "productId": "VALID_PRODUCT_ID",
  "quantity": -1  # Should fail validation
}
```

### 🔄 Complete Wallet Workflow for New Users

1. **Create Account:** `POST /auth/register`

3. **🚨 IMPORTANT: Wallet Top-Up Limitation**
   - ❌ **Users CANNOT add money to their own wallets**
   - ✅ **Only admins can add money using:** `PATCH /wallets/admin/{userId}/balance`
   - ✅ **This is by design for security and compliance**
4. **For Payments: Use Alternative Methods**
   - `"cash"` - Cash on delivery (no wallet needed)
   - `"card"` - Credit/debit card (no wallet needed)
   - `"bank_transfer"` - Bank transfer (no wallet needed)
5. **For Testing: Create Admin Account** to manage wallet top-ups

### 💡 **Why Can't Users Add Money to Their Own Wallets?**

**Security Reasons:**
- Prevents unauthorized money creation
- Ensures proper financial audit trails
- Requires external payment validation
- Complies with financial regulations

**In Production:**
- Users would top up via payment gateways (Paystack, Flutterwave, etc.)
- Bank transfers verified by admins
- Card payments processed by payment processors
- All transactions properly tracked and verified

### 🎯 **Recommended Testing Approach:**

**Option 1: Use Non-Wallet Payments** (Easiest)
```bash
POST /orders/{ORDER_ID}/payment
{
  "amount": 1000,
  "paymentMethod": "cash",  # No wallet required
  "transactionRef": "CASH_001"
}
```

**Option 2: Create Admin for Wallet Testing**
```bash
# 1. Register admin
POST /auth/register
{
  "name": "Test Admin",
  "email": "admin@test.com",
  "password": "AdminPass123!",
  "role": "admin"
}

# 2. Login as admin and fund user wallets
PATCH /wallets/admin/{USER_ID}/balance
{
  "amount": 2000.00,
  "walletType": "foodMoney",
  "transactionType": "credit"
}
```

- Prevents database bloat from abandoned carts

**📊 Cleanup Monitoring:**
- Check server logs for cleanup reports: `"Cart cleanup completed. Removed X expired carts"`
- Cleanup runs automatically via @Cron decorator
- No manual intervention needed

**⚙️ Technical Details:**
- Uses NestJS @Cron and ScheduleModule
- Cleanup method: `CartService.cleanupExpiredCarts()`
- Service: `CartCleanupService` with scheduled task
- Frequency: Daily at 2 AM (configurable)

**🛠️ Admin Cart Monitoring (Future Enhancement):**
```bash
# Potential admin endpoints for cart monitoring:
GET /admin/carts/statistics     # Cart usage stats
GET /admin/carts/expired        # View expired carts before cleanup
POST /admin/carts/cleanup       # Manual cleanup trigger
GET /admin/carts/cleanup-logs   # View cleanup history
```

*Note: The cleanup system is fully automated and requires no admin intervention. These monitoring endpoints could be added for advanced cart management.*

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Authentication Issues
- **Token Expired**: Get new token via login endpoint
- **Invalid Token Format**: Ensure "Bearer " prefix in authorization header
- **Role Mismatch**: Verify user has required role for endpoint access
- **Rate Limiting**: Wait before retrying auth endpoints (5 login attempts, 3 registrations per minute)

### Database Issues
- **Duplicate Key Error**: Ensure unique emails/phone numbers across users
- **Validation Error**: Check required fields and data types in request body
- **Reference Error**: Ensure referenced documents (users, products, orders) exist
- **ObjectId Format**: Use valid MongoDB ObjectId format for ID parameters

### Business Logic Issues
- **Insufficient Stock**: Check product inventory before ordering
- **Invalid Order State**: Follow proper order workflow (cart → checkout → payment)
- **Auction Rules**: Respect bidding rules, timing, and minimum bid increments
- **Wallet Balance**: Ensure sufficient funds before transactions
- **Delivery Assignment**: Only assign to active, verified riders in correct city

### API-Specific Issues
- **Missing Required Fields**: Check Swagger documentation for required parameters
- **Invalid Enum Values**: Use correct enum values for status, role, type fields
- **Date Format**: Use ISO 8601 format for date/time fields
- **Pagination**: Use valid page and limit values for list endpoints
- **File Uploads**: Ensure proper file format and size for document uploads
