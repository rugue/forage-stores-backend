**Files Modified:**
- `src/modules/orders/services/order-state-machine.service.ts` (new)
- `src/modules/orders/orders.service.ts` (integrated state machine)
- `src/modules/orders/orders.controller.ts` (added endpoints)
- `src/modules/orders/orders.module.ts` (registered service)

**Key Features:**
- Role-based transition validation
- Context-aware state changes (payment status, stock availability)
- Comprehensive audit trail with status history
- Admin documentation endpoints

### 2. Status History Tracking ✅

**Implementation:**
- Added `StatusHistory` schema to Order entity
- Automatic tracking of all status changes with timestamps
- Audit trail includes user ID, reason, and transition details
- Integration with state machine for consistent history

**Files Modified:**
- `src/modules/orders/entities/order.entity.ts` (added StatusHistory schema)
- All status change operations now automatically log history

**Key Features:**
- Complete audit trail for compliance
- Timestamp tracking for all changes
- User attribution for accountability
- Reason logging for transparency

### 3. Real-Time Order Updates (Server-Sent Events) ✅

**Implementation:**
- Created `OrderRealTimeService` for managing real-time subscriptions
- Implemented Server-Sent Events (SSE) instead of WebSocket to avoid dependencies
- Added subscription management with user authentication
- Event buffering system for reliable delivery

**Files Modified:**
- `src/modules/orders/gateways/orders.gateway.ts` (new - real-time service)
- `src/modules/orders/orders.controller.ts` (added SSE endpoints)
- `src/modules/orders/orders.service.ts` (integrated broadcasting)
- `src/modules/orders/orders.module.ts` (registered service)

**Key Features:**
- Server-Sent Events for real-time updates
- User-specific subscriptions
- Event buffering and cleanup
- Admin monitoring capabilities
- Connection statistics

### 4. Enhanced Bulk Operations ✅

**Implementation:**
- Created `BulkOperationsService` for efficient bulk order management
- Added validation with state machine integration
- Implemented preview functionality for impact assessment
- Enhanced error reporting and success tracking

**Files Modified:**
- `src/modules/orders/services/bulk-operations.service.ts` (new)
- `src/modules/orders/orders.controller.ts` (added bulk endpoints)
- `src/modules/orders/orders.module.ts` (registered service)

**Key Features:**
- Bulk status updates with validation
- Operation preview and impact assessment
- Comprehensive result reporting
- Export functionality for results
- Real-time updates for bulk changes

## API Endpoints Added

### State Machine Endpoints
- `POST /orders/:id/change-status` - Change order status with validation
- `GET /orders/:id/valid-actions` - Get valid actions for current status
- `GET /orders/state-machine/documentation` - State machine documentation (Admin)

### Real-Time Endpoints
- `GET /orders/events/subscribe` - Subscribe to SSE updates
- `GET /orders/events/stats` - Connection statistics (Admin)

### Bulk Operations Endpoints
- `POST /orders/bulk/status-update` - Bulk status update (Admin)
- `POST /orders/bulk/preview` - Preview bulk operation impact (Admin)
- `POST /orders/bulk/filter` - Get orders for bulk operations (Admin)

## Technical Benefits

### State Management
- **Consistency:** All status changes go through validated state machine
- **Compliance:** Complete audit trail for regulatory requirements
- **Reliability:** Prevents invalid state transitions
- **Flexibility:** Role-based permissions and context-aware validation

### Real-Time Features
- **User Experience:** Instant order status updates
- **Monitoring:** Real-time admin oversight of order processing
- **Scalability:** Efficient event buffering and subscription management
- **Reliability:** No external dependencies (uses native SSE)

### Bulk Operations
- **Efficiency:** Process multiple orders simultaneously
- **Safety:** Preview functionality prevents unintended changes
- **Monitoring:** Comprehensive reporting and statistics
- **Integration:** Full state machine validation for all bulk changes

## Performance Considerations

1. **Event Buffering:** Limited to 50 events per user to prevent memory issues
2. **Bulk Limits:** Maximum 100 orders per bulk operation to maintain performance
3. **Subscription Management:** Automatic cleanup on disconnect
4. **Real-Time Optimization:** Event polling every 1 second for optimal balance

## Security Features

1. **Authentication:** JWT-based authentication for all real-time connections
2. **Authorization:** Role-based access control for bulk operations
3. **Validation:** State machine prevents unauthorized status changes
4. **Audit Trail:** Complete logging of all operations and changes

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
1. Test state machine transitions with different user roles
2. Verify real-time updates work across different browser sessions
3. Test bulk operations with various filter combinations
4. Validate SSE connection handling and cleanup

### Integration Tests
1. State machine transition validation
2. Real-time event broadcasting
3. Bulk operation rollback scenarios
4. Authentication and authorization flows

## Production Deployment Notes

1. **Real-Time Scaling:** Consider Redis for event buffering in multi-instance deployments
2. **Monitoring:** Add metrics for SSE connections and bulk operation performance
3. **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting for bulk operations
4. **Cleanup Jobs:** Schedule periodic cleanup of old status history entries

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

1. **WebSocket Support:** Add optional WebSocket support for high-frequency updates
2. **Push Notifications:** Integrate with mobile push notification services
3. **Advanced Bulk Operations:** Add bulk refund, bulk delivery updates
4. **Analytics Dashboard:** Real-time order processing analytics
5. **Performance Optimization:** Implement Redis caching for frequently accessed data
