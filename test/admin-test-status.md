# Admin Test Suite Status

## Overview
This document tracks the current status of the admin test suite, including improvements, known issues, and future enhancements.

## Current Status
- ✅ Test runner script: `run-admin-tests.sh` is operational
- ✅ Jest configuration: `jest-admin.config.json` is properly configured
- ✅ Global setup/teardown scripts in place
- ✅ Test helpers enhanced with rate limiting handling
- ✅ Unique test data generation with random IDs
- ✅ Improved test isolation between runs

## Recent Improvements
- **Enhanced Authentication**: Added token refresh mechanisms and better error handling
- **Rate Limiting Protection**: Implemented exponential backoff for retries 
- **Test Data Isolation**: Using unique test run IDs to isolate test runs
- **Improved Cleanup**: Better cleanup of test data with more comprehensive collection coverage
- **Unique User Emails**: Added timestamp + random string to prevent email conflicts

## Known Issues
- Test data may remain in database if tests are interrupted before teardown
- Some rate limiting issues may still occur with concurrent test runs

## Usage Tips

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all admin tests
./run-admin-tests.sh --all

# Run specific module tests
./run-admin-tests.sh --module auth
./run-admin-tests.sh --module users

# Run with coverage
./run-admin-tests.sh --all --coverage

# Debug mode (shows more output)
./run-admin-tests.sh --all --debug

# Skip database cleanup (faster but leaves test data)
./run-admin-tests.sh --all --skip-cleanup
```

### Common Issues & Solutions

1. **Authentication failures**:
   - Check that the test users are being created properly
   - Verify token expiration settings in your .env.test file
   - Token refresh is now handled automatically

2. **Rate limiting**:
   - Tests now include automatic retry with backoff
   - If still encountering issues, increase delay times in test helpers

3. **Duplicate test data**:
   - Run with `--clean-db` option before tests to clean existing test data
   - Test data now includes unique markers and test run IDs

## Next Steps
- Add parallel test execution capabilities with proper isolation
- Implement more detailed reporting and failure analysis
- Add transaction isolation for test data creation/cleanup
